# The 10 -Spencer-Cawley
This is an app that allows a user to see movies currently playing in theaters and also upcoming movies.
These two lists are seperated using a tabBarController with 10 movies in each list.

CLicking on a movie cell will allow a user to read an overview of the movie, see the audience raiting and even watch the trailer.

Movies that are currently playing in the theater have a 'Ticket' button that when pressed with present the user with the Fandango website. Doing so allows users to purchase tickets to a movie theater close to their location.
